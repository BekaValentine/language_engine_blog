                <p>In this post, I want to tackle an important issue when designing a lexicon for an app that uses Language Engine, namely: how do you cope with the variety of seemingly different ways that people can express the same or nearly-same idea? For example, consider the following interaction you could imagine taking place in an Instragram-like app:</p>
                
                <p>
                    <em>User:</em> Take a selfie!</em><br/>
                    <em>App:</em> Ok!<br/>
                    *shutter*<br/>
                    <em>App:</em>How's that?<br/>
                    <em>User:</em> Oh, it's awful!<br/>
                    <em>App:</em> What about with one of these filters?<br/>
                    *various versions show on screen*<br/>
                </p>
