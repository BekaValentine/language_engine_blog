            <div class="content">
                <p><em>posted by Beka on 3 Mar 2016</em></p>
                
                <p>Last time, we looked at the very basics of proof refinement systems. I noted at the end that there was a big drawback of the systems as shown, namely that information flows only in one direction: from the root of a proof tree to the leaves. In this post, we'll see how to get information to flow in the opposite direction as well.</p>
                
                <h3>Addition Again</h3>
                
                <p>The addition judgment <span class="code">Plus</span> which we defined last time was a three-argument judgment. The judgment <span class="code">Plus L M N</span> was a claim that <span class="code">N</span> is the sum of <span class="code">L</span> and <span class="code">M</span>. But we might want to instead thing about specifying only some of the arguments to this judgment. In a language like Prolog, this is implemented by the use of metavariables which get valued in the course of computation. In the proof refinement setting, however, we take a different approach. Instead, we make use of a notion called bidirectionality, where we specify that a judgment's arguments can come in two modes: input and output. This is somewhat related to viewing thing from a functional perspective, but in a more non-deterministic or relational fashion.</p>
                
                <p>Let's start by deciding that the mode of the first two arguments to <span class="code">Plus</span> is that of input, and the third is output. This way we'll think about actually computing the sum of two numbers. Instead of three <span class="code">Nat</span> inputs, we'll instead use only two. We'll use a judgment name that reflects which two:</p>

    return { tag: "Plus12", args: [x,y] };

                <p>The behavior of the decomposer for <span class="code">Plus12</span> will have to be slightly different now, tho, because there's only two arguments. But additionally, we want to not only expand a goal into subgoals, but also somehow synthesize a result from the results of the subgoals. So where before we had only to map from a goal to some new goals, now we must also provide something that maps from some subresults to a result.</p>
                
                <p>Rather than giving two separate functions, we'll give a single function that returns both the new subgoals, and the function that composes a value from the values synthesized for those subgoals.</p>

                <p>The <span class="code">decompose</span> function is somewhat redundant in this example, but the shape of the problem is preserved by having this redundancy. The same is true of the <span class="code">Maybe</span> in the types. We can always decompose now, so the <span class="code">Nothing</span> option is never used, but I'm keeping it here to maintain parallelism with the general framework.</p>
                
                <p>Building a proof tree in this setting proceeds very similarly to how it did before, except now we need to make use of the synthesis functions in parallel with building a proof tree:</p>

Therefore, the judgment <span class="code">Plus13 L N</span> means <span class="code">L</span> subtracted from <span class="code">N</span>.

The <span class="code">Check</span> judgment will be used precisely in those cases where a type must be provided for the proof to go through, while the <span class="code">Synth</span> judgment will be used for cases where the structure of the program is enough to tell us its type.</p>

                <p>The last change that we'll make will be to change the notion of synthesis a little bit from what we had before. In the addition section, we said merely that we needed a function that synthesized a new value from some subvalues. More generally, though, we need that process to be able to fail, because we wish to place constraints on the synthesized values. To capture this, we'll wrap the return type in <span class="code">Maybe</span>.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                
                <p>The bidirectional style in this post has some interesting limitations and draw backs. Consider the case of the rule for <span class="code">App</span>: it has to synthesize the type of both the function and the argument and then compare them appropriately. This means that certain programs require additional type annotations to be written. But this is somewhat unnecessary, because once we synthesize the type of the function, we can use that information to <em>check</em> the argument. In the next blog post, I'll try to explain how to do this in a more elegant way, the combines both the upward and downward flows of information.</p>
